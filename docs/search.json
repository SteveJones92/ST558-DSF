    "text": "What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nA data scientist is someone who focuses on the process of integrating computers with statistics and business needs. They have a specialization of computing software to be able to gain insights from data, many times in an automated fashion for use with software.\n\n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nI view it as starting on the same path and diverging at some point. The root is in statistics, but a statistician will continue with more of the rigor of the field directly, whereas a data scientist will begin to branch off more into the software/development process and application side of things.\nSimilarities:\n\nFoundational Knowledge\nTool Use\n\nDifferences:\n\nSpecialized Knowledge\nDevelopment Process\n\n\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nI am much closer to a data scientist. I have exposure to statistics, but as portions of CSC courses. I have had many courses on directly attributed data science topics and I work in software.\n\n\nSetting y variable using a column of the iris dataset and density function\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n\n\n\nChecking the class, type, and structure of y\nclass(y)\n[1] “density”\ntypeof(y)\n[1] “list”\nstr(y)\nList of 8 $ x : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 … $ y : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 … $ bw : num 0.252 $ n : int 150 $ old.coords: logi FALSE $ call : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width) $ data.name : chr “iris$Petal.Width” $ has.na : logi FALSE - attr(*, “class”)= chr “density”\n\n\n\nPlotting y, with code hidden with echo=FALSE"
