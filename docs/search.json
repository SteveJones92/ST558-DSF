    "text": "What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nA data scientist is someone who focuses on the process of integrating computers with statistics and business needs. They have a specialization of computing software to be able to gain insights from data, many times in an automated fashion for use with software.\n\n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nI view it as starting on the same path and diverging at some point. The root is in statistics, but a statistician will continue with more of the rigor of the field directly, whereas a data scientist will begin to branch off more into the software/development process and application side of things.\nSimilarities:\n\nFoundational Knowledge\nTool Use\n\nDifferences:\n\nSpecialized Knowledge\nDevelopment Process\n\n\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nI am much closer to a data scientist. I have exposure to statistics, but as portions of CSC courses. I have had many courses on directly attributed data science topics and I work in software.\n\n\nSetting y variable using a column of the iris dataset and density function\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n\n\n\nChecking the class, type, and structure of y\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting y, with code hidden with echo=FALSE"
